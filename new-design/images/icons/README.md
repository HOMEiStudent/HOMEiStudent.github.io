- **Google Play:** Download from [Google Play badge resources](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/)

### QR Code
Generate a QR code linking to your app:
1. Go to a QR code generator (e.g., qr-code-generator.com)
2. Enter your App Store or a linktree URL
3. Download as PNG at 200x200px or larger
4. Name it `qr-code.png`

### Climate Pledge Logo
If you're part of a climate initiative:
- Use the official logo from that programme
- Or create a simple "1%" badge
- Falls back to 🌍 emoji if not uploaded

## Tips

- Use PNG format with transparent backgrounds
- Keep icons simple and recognisable at small sizes
- Test that they look good on both light and dark backgrounds
